<h1>SignUpSys-Coursework</h1>
<p>Just a simple sign up and login system written in python for some university coursework.<br>
This has only been made public AFTER the submission deadline.<br><br>
Also please do not actually use this, it uses SHA-256 which is now insecure (That was more of a note to me than anyone else).</p>
